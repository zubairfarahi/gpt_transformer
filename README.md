# GPT Transformer Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a GPT-like transformer model built using PyTorch. It's designed to handle a variety of natural language processing tasks, with a focus on both flexibility and performance.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily interchangeable components for experimentation and upgrades.
- **Configurable**: Model parameters can be adjusted using a `config.ini` file.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the model, you need to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Adjust model parameters by editing the `config/config.ini` file. Example settings:

```ini
[GPTModel]
vocab_size = 50257
context_length = 1024
emb_dim = 768
n_heads = 12
n_layers = 12
drop_rate = 0.1
qkv_bias = False
```

## Quick Start

To run the model with custom configurations:

```bash
python3 main.py --config_file path/to/your/config.ini
```

## Usage

### Training

Describe how to train the model with an example command:

```bash
python3 train.py --config_file config/config.ini --data_path path/to/data
```

### Inference

Example command for running inference:

```bash
python3 infer.py --config_file config/config.ini --input_file path/to/input.txt
```
